## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Memory Bank (.memory-bank/) capturing the project brief, technical context,
  system patterns, glossary, and progress.
- Initial specifications under specs/: an overview and feature map plus an
  open-decisions log.
- Pester 5 unit tests for all four public functions and all nine private
  helpers (InModuleScope with TestDrive fixtures and mocked HTTP), bringing
  code coverage to a 25% baseline enforced by the build.
- `Invoke-Shp -ReasoningEffort` (minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max) to
  control model thinking depth, mirroring the effort control in the VS Code
  Copilot model picker. Mapped to reasoning_effort on /chat/completions and
  reasoning.effort on /responses.
- `Invoke-Shp -MaxOutputTokens` to cap the reply length (max_tokens on
  /chat/completions, max_output_tokens on /responses), surfaced together with
  the requested effort on the result object.
- `Get-ShpModel` now surfaces each model's MaxContextWindowTokens (for example
  the 1M context window), MaxOutputTokens, and supported ReasoningEfforts from
  the advertised capability metadata.
- `Select-ShpModel` and `Get-ShpDefault` to set and read a session default
  model (and optional reasoning effort and max output tokens) applied by
  subsequent Invoke-Shp calls when the matching parameter is not supplied.
  Select-ShpModel accepts a model from the pipeline and supports -Clear.
- Conversation continuation: `Invoke-Shp` now continues from the running
  session conversation by default, so a follow-up prompt remembers earlier
  turns automatically (no switch required). `-History` continues from an
  explicit history (the result's History property) for stateless, scriptable
  multi-turn flows. `Get-ShpChat` and `Clear-ShpChat` view and reset the
  session conversation - run `Clear-ShpChat` to start a fresh chat. The
  unreleased `-ContinueChat` switch was removed: continuation is now implicit.- `Invoke-Shp -Stream` streams the reply token-by-token to the host via
  Server-Sent Events on /chat/completions, and - because the service caps
  non-streaming replies far lower - lifts the output ceiling to the model's
  streaming maximum (for example 64000 tokens for claude-opus-4.8 versus 16000
  non-streaming). Combine with `-MaxOutputTokens` for long replies; the full
  reply is still returned on the result's Content member. -Stream forces
  /chat/completions and takes precedence over -ShowThinking's /responses
  routing. Implemented with two new private helpers (Invoke-ShpStreamRequest
  opens the HttpClient SSE response, Read-ShpChatStream reassembles the
  token/tool-call/usage deltas).
### Changed

- Renamed the module from Ghcp to ShellPilot and the cmdlet noun prefix to
  Shp (Initialize-Shp, Get-ShpModel, Invoke-Shp, Get-ShpModelName).
- Renamed the GitHub repository to raandree/ShellPilot.
- Migrated to the Sampler build framework: source split into
  source/Public and source/Private (one function per file) with Prefix.ps1
  and Suffix.ps1, ModuleBuilder compilation, Pester 5 tests, GitVersion
  versioning, and an Azure Pipelines definition (PowerShell 7 only).
- Documented every private helper with a .EXAMPLE and full parameter help,
  and resolved all PSScriptAnalyzer findings (Write-Host suppressed where
  interactive output is intentional, ShouldProcess added to New-DirectoryTool,
  the argument-completer parameters discarded). The TestQuality and helpQuality
  QA gates are enabled.
